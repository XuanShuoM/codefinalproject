        <h1>Earth's temperature has risen by an average of 0.14Â° Fahrenheit (0.08Â° Celsius) per decade since 1880, or about 2Â° F in total.</h1>

            <p>The rate of warming since 1981 is more than twice as fast: 0.32Â° F (0.18Â° C) per decade. 2022 was the sixth-warmest year on record based on NOAA's temperature data. The 2022 surface temperature was 1.55 Â°F (0.86 Â°Celsius) warmer than the 20th-century average of 57.0 Â°F (13.9 Â°C) and 1.90 ËšF (1.06 ËšC) warmer than the pre-industrial period.</p>
            <p>Given the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth's average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means a significant increase in accumulated heat.</p>
            <p class="highlight">In the Global Temperature Feature Page, the users can search data that covers the entire planet. The users can search a specific city or nearby occean, to check the destinations' current temperatures and also the temperature histories. With the graph visualization function, users can select the range of the data and turn them into specific types of charts for further tracking and supervision.</p>

            <p>The concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100Â°F (55Â°C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the "average" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budgetâ€”how much sunlight Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heatâ€”over time.</p>
            <p>To calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomaliesâ€”the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.</p>
            <p>Though warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA's 2021 Annual Climate Report the combined land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees Celsius) per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 Â°F (0.18 Â°C) per decade.</p>
            <p>The amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activitiesâ€”burning fossil fuels and clearing forestsâ€”add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.</p>
            <p>According to the 2017 U.S. Climate Science Special Report, if yearly emissions continue to increase rapidly, as they have since 2000, models project that by the end of this century, global temperature will be at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1901-1960 average, and possibly as much as 10.2 degrees warmer. If annual emissions increase more slowly and begin to decline significantly by 2050,  models project temperatures would still be at least 2.4 degrees warmer than the first half of the 20th century, and possibly up to 5.9 degrees warmer.</p>
